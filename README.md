Data Incubator Project Proposal

Health insurance coverage is the gateway for most Americans to access health care services. But the cost of healthcare coverage itself, as well as the associated costs of co-pays, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses leave many Americans unable to afford health services. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and allowed many people to receive subsidies to purchase insurance on the private market or access to Medicaid, previously only available to children, pregnant women, and the disabled. The ACA was seen as a triumph for Democrats in power when it was enacted and as a threat to civil liberties by Republicans, with many Republican voters eager to retake power in the 2018 elections to repeal the ACA. After Donald Trump (R) was elected in 2018, House Republicans quickly moved to begin a repeal process of the ACA. 

This project uses publicly-available data on Facebook page traffic from January 1, 2015 to July 17, 2018 to assess whether volatility in healthcare utilization and interest can be explained by political announcements regarding actions to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
